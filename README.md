# TestingEnv
A program with no name created for the use of Peregrine Semiconductor to search through a given spreadsheet for an MPAC's
tuning value to find the closest/most efficient values to an input value. Also creates a lookup table if that is the preferred device.

This is currently not particularly fast, it could be made more efficient by sorting all the values first, however with 60,000,000+ values
this may take a really long time to sort in the first place.
